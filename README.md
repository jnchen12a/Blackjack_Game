# Blackjack_Game
A Blackjack game coded for a class project. Class: COP3502C

##Notes
File "blackjack.py" is entirely original, except for the fact that the output had to match instructor's completely.
File "p1_random.py" was given from instructor.

##Description
Allows the user to play blackjack games against the dealer (CPU). A very simplified version of blackjack. Random number generator generates the same number each time, since generated numbers are derived from the "p1_random.py" file.
